I accidentally became a **software developer**,  
then a **hardware developer**,  
then a **product developer**,  
and somewhere along the way… an **IT guy with a homelab addiction**. 😅  

Now I’m basically a **one-man product team**:
- 🖥️ Write the firmware (ESP32, ESPHome, YAML, Proxmox scripts)  
- 🔌 Wire the hardware (and sometimes let the magic smoke out)  
- ⚙️ Design the enclosures (Fusion360, 3D prints, custom racks)  
- 🛠️ Build & repair machines (currently re-working a Voron)  
- 🌐 Run the backend (Proxmox, OPNsense, Pi-hole, self-hosted services)

## 🧰 My toolbox
- **Software:** ESPHome, Arduino, YAML, Proxmox, Linux, GitHub  
- **Hardware:** ESP32, LED panels, custom electronics, 3D printers  
- **Design:** Fusion360, CAD, PETG/PLA/ABS, carbon-fiber sheets 😉  
- **Homelab:** Proxmox, OPNsense, Pi-hole, Docker, random experiments

## 📦 Current Projects
- 🔒 Classified, but 100% legal 😇  
- 🖨️ Voron rebuild (with upgrades, of course).  
- 🧑‍🔬 Whatever else I break and then fix.  
- 🔴 **[YT-Subscriber-Counter-Enhanced](https://github.com/AdamDeBeers/ESP32-projects/tree/main/YT-Subscriber-Counter-Enhanced)**  
  ESPHome project to show live YouTube subscribers on an LED matrix.

## 🤓 Fun facts
- I *might* have more 3D printers than shoes.  
- I don’t let the smoke out of my components anymore… usually.  
- Every repo starts private until I stop being shy.  
- I call myself a “Full-Stack Maker” because it sounds cooler than “Guy who can’t pick one hobby.”

## 🚀 Mission
Build cool things. Learn along the way.  
If it makes noise, blinks, or prints in plastic — I’m in.  
Did you say I can print with your metal 3D printer and you will pay me for that?  
You call that a job? I am in!
